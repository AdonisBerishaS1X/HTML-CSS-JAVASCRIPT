        <h2>Speed and Ferocity</h2>
        <p>
          An Assault Marine is a close support Firstborn Space Marine who is equipped with weapons that are specialised towards melee combat at close quarters and serves as part of an Assault Squad. The term Assault Marine refers to Imperial Space Marines equipped in such a manner; Chaos Space Marines have similar units called Chaos Raptors.

Assault Marines are powerful melee fighters able to best almost any opponent in the bloody close-quarters melee fighting that is such a common feature of warfare in the late 41st Millennium. Each Assault Squad consists of up to 10 battle-brothers of whom one will be the unit leader with the rank of sergeant.

        <h2>Weapons of Vengeance</h2>
        <p>
         The Jump Pack is easily as dangerous as any weapon the Assault Marine carries, propelling its bearer into the heart of combat with the force of a hurtling meteorite. More importantly though, with a Jump Pack comes mobility, allowing the Assault Squad to redeploy quickly in a series of hard-hitting attacks, or even perform controlled low-altitude descents from Thunderhawk gunships.

Assault Squads draw some of the most brutal of all battle assignments. Often operating ahead of the rest of the Astartes army, Assault Marines are ever in danger of being outflanked, cut off, or simply overwhelmed by the enemy every time they deploy. Even if an Assault Squad is knee-deep in corpses and fighting for their lives, its Sergeant must be aware not only of his current situation, but also any imminent or potential developments that will leave his battle-brothers stranded in a sea of bloodthirsty foes.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
         Modern Assault Marines can trace their origins to over ten thousand standard years ago during the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy eras in the late 30th and early 31st Millennia. Legion Assault Squads were the rapid attack formations of the ancient Space Marine Legions. These Jump Pack-equipped Legion Assault Squads were rapid attack forces whose wargear was optimised towards close-quarters fighting and hit-and-run tactics.

The use of Jump Packs allowed Legion Assault Squads to move with greater speed across the battlefield and impact the enemy line with savage force, leaping past intervening terrain and open defences to engage their adversaries in bloody melee. The needs of even such limited flight systems, however, precluded the use of heavy weaponry or extensive munitions supplies.

Jump Pack-equipped Assault Squads were not embraced to the same extent by all of the Legions for reasons of combat doctrine, temperament or simple resource difficulties. The Legion Assault Squad was the precursor of the modern Assault Squads of the Adeptus Astartes still utilised in the late 41st Millennium.
