      <h2>The Black Rage</h2>
      <p>
        The Blood Angels Chapter and their successors among the Sanguinary Brotherhood still suffer from a genetic flaw that creates mental instability called the Black Rage, also known as the "Flaw of Sanguinius," as a result of the psychic imprint left by their Primarch Sanguinius' death at the hands of Horus during the Siege of Terra.

Blood Angels are unique amongst the Space Marines in that deeply engrained in their gene-seed is the encoded experience of their primarch, and most deeply imprinted of all is the memory of Sanguinius' final battle with Horus.

Sometimes, on the eve of battle, an event or circumstance will trigger this "genetic memory" and the battle-brother's mind is suddenly wrenched into the distant past. The Black Rage overcomes the Blood Angel as the memories and consciousness of Sanguinius intrude upon his mind, and dire events ten thousand Terran years old flood into the present. This can cause Blood Angels Astartes to go insane prior to or during battle and feel the uncontrollable rage of Sanguinius himself during the final days of the Siege of Terra.

      <h2></h2>
      <p>
       A warrior overcome with the Black Rage appears half-mad with fury; he is unable to distinguish past from present and does not recognise his comrades. He may believe he is Sanguinius upon the eve of his destruction, and the bloody battles of the Horus Heresy are still raging all around him. Such a battle-brother stands at the end of his travails, for his path leads only to the Death Company, where he and the Chapter's other damned souls will fight one final battle in Sanguinius' name.

      <h2>Legacy and Sacrifice</h2>
      <p>
       Rather than let their afflicted brethren face a slow, insane death, the Blood Angels and their successors will form those of their battle-brothers who have newly succumbed to the Black Rage into a special unit of the Chapter known as the "Death Company." They wear specially painted black power armour, daubed with red crosses to symbolise the wounds of Sanguinius and are often led by the few Chapter officers, notably Chaplains, who are able to communicate orders to the insane troops. They are then sent out to perform the most dangerous assaults, hoping for a quick and honourable death in combat.

However, by some unknown means, the genetic flaw in the Blood Angels' gene-seed that produces the Black Rage also seems capable of extending the victim's lifespan, at least until he finally succumbs to the Rage. Commander Dante, the Chapter Master of the Blood Angels, is by far the oldest living Loyalist Space Marine (not including those interred in a Dreadnought), born more than 1000 Terran years before the present time, a feat that may only have been possible because of the genetic flaw he bears.
