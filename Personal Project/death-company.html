      <h2>The Black Rage</h2>
      <p>
        The Death Company are those who have succumbed to the Black Rage, a psychic curse that afflicts the Blood Angels. Plagued by visions of their primarch’s final moments during the Horus Heresy, they lose themselves to madness and bloodlust.

      <h2>Armor and Role</h2>
      <p>
        Clad in midnight black armor adorned with red crosses and purity seals, the Death Company are driven into battle not as pariahs, but as sacred weapons of vengeance. Wielding chainswords and bolt pistols, they charge fearlessly into the heart of the enemy.

      <h2>Legacy and Sacrifice</h2>
      <p>
        Though doomed, their sacrifice is honored. Many battles have turned by their wild fury, and tales of their final charges are etched into Chapter lore. To be chosen for the Death Company is both a tragedy and a mark of purity beyond corruption.
