        <h2>Legacy of Sanguinius</h2>
        <p>
          The Sanguinary Guard, known during the Great Crusade as the Ikisat or the "Burning Ones," for their ardour and unwavering devotion, are the most elite Veteran Astartes of the Blood Angels Space Marine Chapter. The Sanguinary Guard essentially serves as the Blood Angels' version of a Chapter honour guard.

A Sanguinary Guard unit is also present in all Blood Angels successors of the Sanguinary Brotherhood whose lineage can be traced back to the dark days of the Horus Heresy.

        <h2>Golden Angels of Death</h2>
        <p>
          Adorned in ornate golden armor and wielding encarmine blades and angelus-pattern boltguns, the Sanguinary Guard descend into battle like vengeful seraphim. Their angelic visages and wings strike fear into the heretic and inspiration into the hearts of loyalists.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
         The lineage of the Sanguinary Guard can be traced back to the bygone era of the Great Crusade when they acted as the elite bodyguard of Primarch Sanguinius, fighting alongside the Great Angel through the most terrible of battles on such worlds as Dalos, Blindhope, Signus Prime and countless others.

Considered an Order of what the primarch designated the elite First Sphere of the IX Legion, the Sanguinary Guard were also called the Ikisat, the "Burning Ones," because of the sheer fire of their devotion to their primarch.

Like every member of the First Sphere, the Astartes of the Sanguinary Guard surrendered their ranks and original names, taking only the title of "Seraph" so that they could help eliminate the self and do their primarch's work without guilt or regret, focussed only on their duty of protecting Sanguinius' person. On rare occasions, they were also assigned as guards for other commanders as a sign of the Great Angel's favour.

They served with the primarch until he perished in the assault on the Warmaster Horus' battle barge Vengeful Spirit during the final hours of the Siege of Terra. Only a lone member of the Sanguinary Guard survived that final confrontation.
