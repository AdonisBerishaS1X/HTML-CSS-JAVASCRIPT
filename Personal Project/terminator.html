        <h2>Heavy Armor Titans</h2>
        <p>
         Terminators are Space Marine Veterans who have earned the right to wear Tactical Dreadnought Armour, better known as Terminator Armour. They are their Chapter's greatest infantry assets, each essentially serving as a walking tank.

Tactical Dreadnought Armour combines the technological developments of power armour with the sealed environmental suits designed for starship crews that work in highly unstable or corrosive environments such as inside the high pressure casings of Plasma Reactor shields. It can even withstand the colossal impact of high speed orbital micro debris.

Terminators are always members of the elite 1st Company of a Codex Astartes-compliant Space Marine Chapter.

All suits of Terminator Armour have built-in teleportation devices which allow them to deploy anywhere on a planetary surface via a so-called "deep strike," although more often they are deployed using Land Raiders. Terminator Squads consist of a Terminator sergeant and between 4 and 9 Terminators.

        <h2>Shock Assault Specialists</h2>
        <p>
        Every Space Marine Chapter maintains a number of suits of revered Tactical Dreadnought Armour. Terminator suits are the pinnacle of armoured protection available to a Space Marine. Each is all but impervious to small arms fire and can even withstand the merciless onslaught of anti-tank weaponry or the titanic pressures of teleportation through the Warp.

Terminator Armour, created just before the outbreak of the Horus Heresy, is incredibly rare. Space Marines hold it a great honour to be permitted to wear such a suit in battle, and it is only to members of the Chapter's elite 1st Company who have earned the status of Veterans that this honour is granted.

It requires rigorous standard years of extra training to fight in Terminator Armour. Each warrior so armoured is expected to act as an example to the rest of his brethren by fighting in the most difficult of missions and performing beyond even the lofty standards of the Adeptus Astartes.

Boarding Tyranid-infested space hulks, launching teleport deep strike attacks behind enemy lines, assaulting enemy Titans and spearheading combat actions upon Death Worlds; these are the missions undertaken by Space Marine Terminators.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
         Space Marine power armour has a long and glorious history, its origins dating back to the long-forgotten Age of Technology before the Emperor of Mankind's Unification of Terra.

Nothing is now known of this time, but it is speculated that suits of powered armour were worn by the techno-barbarians that fought alongside the Emperor as He battled to bring Terra under His rule in the 30th Millennium. Over time, these suits were refined and improved, becoming the earliest incarnations of fully enclosed power armour.

The first suits of Space Marine power armour were developed from this armour and were said to have been worn by the first Astartes of the early Space Marine Legions as they fought to unite the planets of the Sol System under the Emperor's control.

Legend tells that once the Terran system was secure, and the process of rebuilding firmly in hand, the galactic conquest of the Great Crusade began. Faded techno-arcana of the Adeptus Mechanicus tell that even before the Age of Strife had ended, the Emperor had started to make provisions for His Great Crusade to reunify Mankind.

The preparations for the Great Crusade included the re-equipping of the Space Marine Legions with a far more sophisticated suit of power armour that Imperial historians have dubbed Mark II "Crusade" or "Crusader" Pattern Power Armour. Alongside these developments, the Emperor initiated a program to develop a new suit of power armour that would provide even greater protection than that offered by the standard marks of power armour for Space Marines.
